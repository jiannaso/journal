            after a summer of reflection, i left a 1.5 year long relationship 1 whole month ago. words inevitably flatten the experience of what it feels like to do so. since then, i’ve lived lifetimes—many worlds within me have been broken and rebuilt. i’ve sought solace in friends and read literature to stabilize my perception on the philosophy of love, how our brains operate around it, and what people prioritize and envision in its manifestation for themselves. while i can theorize all day, love is ultimately something that we can only learn by living and practicing. it is my life force but an intangible, incomprehensible feeling. an intuition that i am guided by but struggle to hold in my hands. for a while now, i’ve defined love as bending time and space to allow others to shape you: wanting every moment to last longer, revisiting memories together, eternalizing them somehow. this breakup has only deepened the temporal aspect of this definition. love has stretched my days, condensed every hour, filled seconds with fleeting memories, and brought the past into the present.
  <br></br>
  
  many moments in this relationship, i thought to myself: “i have never been truly loved before this and he is proof”. every moment reshaped my perspective of past partners. my favorite quality of any person, experience, or idea is that it is expansive, gently ushering me beyond the bounds of what i know or think is possible. for a year and a half, he expanded how love felt in my body. early on, the relationship comforted and calmed me at a nervous-system level. after a lifetime of sleep being out of my reach and waking up with my heartbeat as an alarm clock, my nights were finally quiet and restful. the days were full of surprise peaches and flowers and fluffy pancakes. spending time together somehow transformed the mundanity of academic life into something to savor. life felt like eternal spring; i never knew it could be so stable, so sweet, so silly. every time i looked in his eyes, i knew he loved me. i felt like i was floating. suddenly this amorphous feeling took form right in front of me, like a ripe iridescent fruit, ready for me to harvest and taste. to look in those same eyes and definitively say that we had to part felt like the worst thing i have ever done. i plucked the fruit from the tree just to leave it in the grass. still, in every moment, i have been grateful for the gift of our time together.
  <br></br>
  dating is an introspective practice; only alongside another person and in such intimate relations have I felt so close to myself. in my seasons of dating, i’ve sought to learn about different parts of my heart and mind, slowly forming my self-concept as a lover. i learned early on that love was defined by feeling unequivocably understood. in the relationships that preceded this one, i prioritized what i thought were “superficial” forms of understanding: how we crafted a joke, the way we internalized lyrics, even the silhouettes we preferred in the clothes we wore. quickly, it became clear that this chemistry alone could not feed me in the long term. when i moved to boston, i looked for deeper understanding, hoping that it would make love blossom sustainably, even if gradually. i found a partner who was kind in his bones, prioritized me without hesitation, deeply cared for every aspect of my wellbeing, and was gentle in every conversation. i could easily envision a future together, which had never materialized with anyone else. somehow, he understood me at a deeper level i didn’t realize i needed, even though we were superficially different. but seeds of misunderstanding grew, sprouting resentment-filled vines that wrapped around my chest until it was too uncomfortable to bear. i now know that all forms of understanding are intertwined. there are latent constructs of my being–which mostly boil down to taste and identity–that must be watered, whether they are intuitively or actively learned.
  <br></br>
  when i close my eyes, i can still relive our last conversation, but the days after are a blur. it hurt to exist in a place that had been shaped by our relationship for so long. the sadness would start in the pit of my stomach and pour out through my eyes. it was harrowing to regress back into a baby who needed to be constantly swaddled. i woke up crying, unable to get out of bed, choosing to go back to sleep just so that i wouldn’t feel the aches in my body. the sun would rise and set while i did nothing at all. at 4pm, i’d feel pangs of hunger but lost the strength to get up and feed myself. when i did eat, i had to remind myself to chew, swallow, and consume enough to feel full. basic life tasks became impossible. it was raining in my head and my body became a heavy pool. without realizing, i spent hours replaying moments and questioning my decision. in an attempt to retrain the chemicals in my brain and form new neural pathways, i filled my days with distractions. my mind remained elsewhere, mostly in the past. it was all i talked about for two weeks. in advising meetings and the office and meals and calls, my breakup narrative would flow out of me. it became a well-oiled performance. i lived the same night over and over again until it tired me to think of. i had to remind myself of all the heartbreak that had inevitably faded before. the certainty of time passing saved me. i knew that days and weeks and months and years would pass, and my body would no longer recognize these feelings.
  <br></br>
  in the midst of all of this, and likely a key factor in how i was operating at the end, i’ve been in a major mental health spiral. my ocd, a lifelong friend, became a true diva in july. time escaped me as i obsessed over minute or unimportant tasks. one of those obsessions became knitting; i would knit without rest until my wrists were tight and my fingertips were raw. when i closed my eyes, i would envision my yarn and needles, my hands mentally planning the future steps of my project. hours of my summer were lost to overzealous repetition beyond this. crucially, i did not notice the subtle changes that led up to this shift. one day, i just realized that my symptoms were more intense than before. how could i have missed the signs? i felt like i no longer understood myself.
  <br></br>
  this feeling was especially peculiar since my days are spent exploring how our bodies and minds move through time in response to invisible disease. in my research, i talk to people with neurodegenerative conditions, like ataxias, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple system atrophy, about the way they document and process the changing world of their body. these conditions progress slowly and almost unnoticeably. seemingly insignificant changes, such as voice tremors or shaky hands, build on each other until the shift is stark and unrecognizable. many of them describe a point at which their understanding of themselves no longer matches the reality of their abilities, a process that naturally comes with aging but is accelerated by disease. this means that mundane daily tasks like closing doors and picking up glasses of water suddenly lead to serious injury. a small gap in their inner world can cause a major shift in their outer world. they often start depending on others’ perceptions of themselves to complete their own, enveloped in the multiplicity of how their conditions are perceived and treated. managing their health entails the tedious task of coordinating realities. i philosophize about how body sensor data and visualization can bridge physical and mental realities, even predicting later progression. other health informatics scholars ask if our futures are within ourselves at all. it quickly becomes an abstract conversation: which realities matter? how prepared can we be for the unknown? what do we want to know about our futures? how should we spend our time on this earth, preparing or living?
  <br></br>
  though in entirely different spaces of the world, all these aspects of my life coalesce around a pattern i often hyperfixate on: how small details scale to faraway future issues. my stress is often rooted in extrapolating fleeting moments of reality to distant hypotheticals, to an almost irrational degree. in my relationship, every misalignment made me worried about a future conflict. with my ocd, an almost imperceptible detail can lead to a time-sucking obsession. with the patients i work with, subtle changes in daily life build up to severe disability. every second in life feels inescapably connected. the forces that drive change are infuriatingly invisible: understanding, health, intuition. and love, though hard to grasp, shapes the seconds i live in the most.
  <br></br>
  i am writing this to put my thoughts somewhere beyond my head and body. my side quest the past month has been conducting a personal ethnography on the state of love in my friend group and in this generation more broadly. i love to hear how people relate to these musings, especially those who are years into a college romance or decades into a stable marriage. i have heard many forms of hopecore, my favorite one being from a friend who described a past partner as someone she built a third universe with, just for themselves to play in. my vision of love has been reshaped every day.
  <br></br>
  i also want to offer (out here in the big black hole of the internet where 5 people might read this and that is okay) a huge bouquet of love for anyone who has felt even a smidge similar. i’ve always believed that breakups are expansive, in that they simply redirect your love. this month, i’ve reconnected with people from all eras of my life and rediscovered how i like to spend time with myself. the love i gained and spent on that relationship is now more strongly funneled into my friendships and hobbies and family and my health. i’ve gotten a lot of personal and clinical support for my ocd for the first time, which has been life-changing (please reach out if you are a fellow ocdiva and want to chat about it!!)
  <br></br>
  my relationship felt like a little world to me, one that was beautiful and safe. sometimes my head feels like its own world too, one that i am forever stuck in. but the world is much bigger than the worlds shaped by our current circumstances. it is hard to exist in this world. another world is always possible. time will pass, and we will get there.
