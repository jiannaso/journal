              welcome to my website of 2025, using fonts and images by filipino designers (and the shining star is the Vengeance font by <a href='https://allicunanan.gumroad.com/'>Alli Cunanan</a>) 🌸

              i secretly redo my portfolio twice a year, exploring it as a creative playground instead of corporate performance. there is no “vibe coding”— i speak poems to my code editor, defining each data point and pixel by hand. <br></br> 
  
              this is a personal digital space independent of big tech. it’s how i want the internet to remember me. solitude is my favorite place to create, where no one sees me, where i can design selfishly and freely. i remember posting bits of my work in 2019 and immediately getting questions about whether i was selling it and where people could buy it. though it was kind and sweet, i felt misunderstood; it seemed like people saw something beautiful and their first thought was wanting it for themselves. i stopped sharing so freely. i waited weeks and months to post projects, taking time to bask in their meaning and complexities and imperfections. everything i make is to remember myself, my family, and our histories. i hated feeling like that was reduced to consumption, and for my work to be shaped by external expectation.
              <br></br> 
              when i started my phd and was gifted all my hours to work on whatever i wanted, i felt incredibly light. now, i want to align my perception of myself with my reality. i am leaving my design turtle shell because connecting about art is the most special feeling. and i love this safe small website. let’s play together :~)
