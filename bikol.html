    In the Philippines, dialects can differ from town to town. Driving an hour in any direction might require translation. The well-traveled ear can piece together a life story: grammar, dialect, and accent might reveal the city a person grew up in, other places they spent their lives, the islands their lineage is from, and the physical or linguistic spaces in which they feel most comfortable. 
    
    <br></br>
    In California, my parents brought their hometowns to the bay area. They grew up an hour-long drive away from each other in the same Bikol province, in towns that had distinct subdialects. They speak both dialects fluently and know each other through four shared Filipino languages: Tagalog, Bikol, Bikol-Sorsogon, and Bikol-Matnog. Spanish and English were both required learning when they were in school, so that can counts as six shared languages total. In terms of love as understanding, they model a baseline neccessity to know loved ones through their mother tongue. For my parents, there are at least three ways to say anything. A small example is <b>yes</b> <i>(oo, amo, mao)</i> and <b>no</b> <i>(hindi, diri, lain)</i>. They speak all forms with ease and without distinction. Once woven together, these variations make infinite expressions possible. All the language I absorbed from them and our teleseryes melded into one unique, unified dialect, creating a hyperlocal language just for us. <b>Bikol-So</b>. When I talk to other Filipino speakers, I find it difficult to remember the bounds between one dialect and another, slipping in and out of being externally intelligible. To me, this personal dialect makes perfect sense.
    <br></br>
    
    In a land that is not home, our commonalities keep our community together, including our national language, Filipino (the standardized form of Tagalog). Still, the way we talk about being Filipino-American leaves room to better honor how our parents' provinces uniquely shape our identity here. Bikol is beautifully crafted, and it has crucially crafted me in turn. Hearing it and speaking it is a sort of sensory experience, as its structure and cadence invite expression and emotion. Bikol is the only family of languages that has an "angry" register that represents a spectrum of emotional intensity (<a href="https://zorc.net/RDZorc/BIKOL/AngryRegister-Bikol[Lobel-2005].pdf">Lobel 2005</a>), coined as <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/regionaltv/features/106518/spicier-than-bicol-express-the-worlds-fiercest-linguistic-quirk/story/">the world's fiercest linguistic quirk</a>. The word for rain is "uran"; when the speaker is upset, it becomes "bagrat" [thank you for the example <a href="'https://www.tiktok.com/@etymologynerd/video/7432327383295724831">@etymologynerd</a>. It is deeply passionate as well; the Bikol word for "love" is "padaba", but it goes much deeper. My parents describe "padaba" as to care for, to adore, to cherish, to treat another as if they are the most precious being in the world. "Baba", my dad's nickname for us, stems from it. This word is the basis of how my family taught me to treat my life and everyone in it. Words also scale with intensity-- when emphasizing feeling, words themselves are <a href="https://wikis.swarthmore.edu/ling073/Bikol/Grammar">elongated</a> with the suffix "-on". "padaba" turns into "padaba<b>on</b>". Both the feeling and the word that captures it are bigger. Filipino language in general is relational, as Professor describes it, and community-driven. Every verb conjugation represents a different type of relationship. Pronouns change depending on whether the speaker you are talking to is part of the event or topic you're discussing. If you're talking to someone about a picnic you went to together, "us" is "tayo" (inclusive). If they are not included, "us" is "kami" (exclusive). Filipino language, especially pre-colonization, is liberatory. As in many languages, there is no gender, resisting the gendered conjugations of spanish for over 300 years. These linguistic details are small reminders of a more radically accepting past, where communities would celebrate <a href="https://apa.si.edu/babaylan/">baybaylan</a>, genderfluid religious leaders who were seen as closer to god.

    In the province, most dialects are heritage languages; they are only learned and spoken ouside of the classroom. Instead, the community is teacher. Children people pick up language while being coo'd at as babies and playing games on the street with their neighborhood. These local dialects are not well-documented publicly, other than by foreigners who have come to conduct linguistic research. The only documentation I've found of <a href="">Matnog</a> and <a href="">Sorsogon</a> Bikol online are from 1970, handwritten and limited. Despite this, heritage languages have survived and flourished intergenerationally despite institutions that seek to erase them, especially given how colonizational left spanish and english in our last names and in the Philippine education system. However, the future is uncertain for heritage languages broadly: "UNESCO estimates, roughly half of the world’s 7,159 languages may vanish by this century’s end, as speakers shift toward majority tongues that promise economic advancement or social prestige". Losing language means losing memory and identity. The <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/seac/2025/07/21/metro-manilas-linguistic-paradox-a-melting-pot-on-the-brink/">London School of Economics</a> puts it best: 'When a language dies, we lose millennia of ecological wisdom hidden in proverbs, unique oral histories, and the worldviews embedded in local grammar.'

    Beyond love, and as with any language, there is so much that cannot be translated from Tagalog or Bikol, especially humor. I find Filipino people ridiculously funny and clever in a way even i cannot comprehend. Growing up with Filipino media, especially Filipino comedians, completely shaped my own way of wording and delivery. If I could have a superpower, I'd want be able to speak and understand any language just to understand jokes in people's mother tongue. I've loved these powerful passages from books this year about language as well, which capture more than I could ever know:

      “As the men carry the girl out of what used to be her home, she asks if they’re going to take her to the cemetery. One of the men says, <i>Mashallah, mashallah</i>.
      <br></br>

			In literal translation, the word means: What God wills. A closer approximation of meaning—of one meaning—is something like: What has happened is what God willed. But English, tasked with a word like this, turns stiff and monophonic, and <i>Mashallah</i> is orchestral. To any ear that grew up on this language, it is clear that what the man means when he says this word is something else entirely. Something instantly familiar to generations who’ve heard it spilling out of the mouths of beaming grandmothers at the end of piano recitals and graduation ceremonies and at the first sight of a newborn. Used this way, it finds its principal “purpose, as an expression of joy. Look at this wonderful thing God has done.”

      <br></br>

      “The girl on the stretcher believes she has ended. A man says to her: <i>Inti zay el amar</i>.
      <br></br>

			You are like the moon. Again, translation fails. There is no English equivalent to the lineage of this phrase, a lineage that runs through generations of old movies and love songs and family gatherings. Listen to the sly setting joy and pleading, raw pleading that carries the words as this man tells the girl who lived when so many others died that she is beautiful beyond the bounds of this world.”

      Had history been different, I would likely speak Bodewadmimwin, or Potawatomi, an Anishinaabe language. But, like many of the three hundred and fifty indigenous languages of the Americas, Potawatomi is threatened, and I speak the language you read.

    But a few summers ago, at our yearly tribal gathering, a language class was held and I slipped into the tent to listen. There was a great deal of excitement about the class because, for the first time, every single fluent speaker in our tribe would be there as a teacher. When the speakers were called forward to the circle of folding chairs, they moved slowly—with canes, walkers, and wheelchairs, only a few entirely under their own power. I counted them as they filled the chairs. Nine. Nine fluent speakers. In the whole world. Our language, millennia in the making, sits in those nine chairs. The words that praised creation, told the old stories, lulled my ancestors to sleep, rests today in the tongues of nine very mortal men and women. Each in turn addresses the small group of would-be students.

    A man with long gray braids tells how his mother hid him away when the Indian agents came to take the children. He escaped boarding school by hiding under an overhung bank where the sound of the stream covered his crying. The others were all taken and had their mouths washed out with soap, or worse, for “talking that dirty Indian language.” Because he alone stayed home and was raised up calling the plants and animals by the name Creator gave them, he is here today, a carrier of the language. The engines of assimilation worked well. The speaker’s eyes blaze as he tells us, “We’re the end of the road. We are all that is left. If you young people do not learn, the language will die. The missionaries and the U.S. government will have their victory at last.” A great grandmother from the circle pushes her walker up close to the microphone. “It’s not just the words that will be lost,” she says. “The language is the heart of our culture; it holds our thoughts, our way of seeing the world. It’s too beautiful for English to explain.”.

    Currently, one of my main life-threads is to craft a relationship to my culture, language, and country that is separate from my family. My parents left in the 90's; even though they visit often, their version of the Philippines is not necessarily its present-day form, or the same one that I perceive and love. But they've gifted me with pride in our heritage, an optimistic vision of its future, and concrete ways we can work towards it. It is very serious work to stay connected to culture and history. I have taken every opportunity to take Filipino classes in school and expect this to be a lifelong learning journey. Right now, I am in an advanced Filipino class in which we write essays and give speeches, the most formal expressions of Filipino I've ever had to do. The practice is mind-bending. While the language already feels intuitive, it is transformative to relearn its formal rules. I learn grammar and vocubulary that goes beyond the topics or colloquialisms from conversations with my parents or lola. My Professor (the amazing <a href="https://thefilam.net/archives/39263">Ate Lady</a> who is the first Harvard Filipino teacher!) is not as forgiving when I slip into the wrong word or verb tense, giving me rigor and encouragement that I don't get at home. I learn Filipino phrases for the Real World of economics, politics, journalism, and philosophy. It is difficult. Shockingly, I learned the formal word for teacher (guro) for the first time this year. The building blocks of my understanding are simply being rearranged with more structure and sorted into buckets of dialectic differentiation. (Sidenote: given how challenging this is in a language I already know, I admire all the polyglots of the world starting from scratch)

    All this to say, happy Filipino American History Month! Being Filipino is a practice of honoring our elders in every possible way, working towards justice and freedom, and crafting a better future for generations we will never know. All this starts small; I am finally rebuilding my Filipino community in Boston after being separated from the bay for two years and it is saving my life to be around them and hear the language every day. I hope everyone gets to find their cultural community too, and find themselves within their history.
