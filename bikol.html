    In the Philippines, language is hyperlocal. Dialects can differ from town to town. Driving an hour in any direction might require translation. The well-traveled ear can piece together a life story: grammar, dialect, and accent might reveal the city a person grew up in, other places they spent their lives, what other islands their lineage is from, and the physical or linguistic spaces in which they feel most comfortable. 
    
    <br></br>
    In California, my parents brought their hometowns to the bay area. They grew up an hour away from each other in the same Bikol province, in towns that had distinct subdialects. They speak both dialects fluently and know each other through four shared Filipino languages: Tagalog, Bikol, Bikol-Sorsogon, and Bikol-Matnog. Spanish and english were both required learning when they were in school, so that can counts as six languages total. In terms of love as understanding, they model a baseline neccessity to know loved ones through their mother tongue. For my parents, there are at least three ways to say anything. A small example is yes (oo, amo, mao) and no (hindi, diri, lain). They speak all forms with ease and without distinction. Once woven together, these variations make infinite expressions possible. All the language i absorbed in their presence melded into one unified dialect, creating a hyperlocal language just for us. Bikol-So. When i talk to other Filipino speakers, i never realize the bounds between one dialect and another, slipping in and out of being externally intelligible. To me, this personal dialect makes perfect sense.
    <br></br>
    Our shared heritage brings us together, but our distinct roots keep us unique. 
    
    Being Filipino-American is discussed as a monolith, and there is so much room to honor how our parents' home provinces uniquely shape our identity here. Bikol is beautifully crafted, and it has crucially crafted me in turn. Hearing it and speaking it is a sort of sensory experience, as its structure and cadence invites expression and emotion. It is the only family of languages that has verb conjugations that indicate anger. The rain can be described as ; when the rain is particularly . It is deeply passionate as well; the Bikol word for "love" is "padaba", but it goes much deeper. My parents describe "padaba" as to care for, to adore, to cherish, to treat another as if they are the most precious being in the world. "baba", my dad's nickname for us, stems from it. This word is the basis of how my family taught me to treat my life and everyone in it. Words also scale with intensity-- when emphasizing feeling, words themselves are elongated. "padaba" turns into "padaba**on**". Both the feeling and the word that captures it are bigger. Filipino language in general is community-driven. Every verb conjugation represents a different type of relationship. Pronouns change depending on whether the speaker you are talking to is part of the event or topic you're discussing. If you're talking to someone about a picnic you went to together, "us" is "tayo" (inclusive), and if not, "us" is "kami" (exclusive). Filipino language, especially pre-colonization, is liberatory. As in many languages, there is no gender. It resisted the gendered conjugations of spanish. These linguistic details are small reminders of a more progressive history, where communities would celebrate baybaylan, genderfluid religious leaders who were seen as closer to god.

    In the province, most dialects are heritage languages. The community is teacher. Local dialects are not well-documented publicly, other than by foreigners who have come to conduct linguistic research. They are not taught in school. Instead, people pick it up while being coo'd at as babies and playing games on the street with their neighborhood. Heritage languages have survived and flourished despite institutions that seek to erase them; colonization left spanish and english in our education system. Despite that, language has been well-preserved intergenerationally.

    Beyond love, and as with any language, there is so much that cannot be translated from Tagalog or Bikol, especially humor. I find Filipino people ridiculously funny and clever in a way even i cannot comprehend. Growing up with Filipino media, especially Filipino comedians, completely shaped my own way of wording and delivery. If i had a superpower, i would be able to speak and understand any language just to understand jokes in people's mother tongue. I've loved these snippets from books about language as well, driving my desire to somehow stretch my brain and learn each one:

    Currently, one of my main life-threads is to craft a relationship to my culture, language, and country that is separate from my family. My parents left in the 90's; even though they visit often, their version of the Philippines is not necessarily its present-day form, or the same one that I perceive and love. But they've gifted me with pride in our heritage, an optimistic vision of its future, and concrete ways we can work towards it. It is very serious work to stay connected to culture and history. I have taken every opportunity to take Filipino classes in school and expect this to be a lifelong learning journey. Right now, i am in an advanced Tagalog class in which we write essays and give speeches, the most formal expressions of Tagalog i've ever had to do. The practice is mind-bending. While the language already feels intuitive, it is always transformative to relearn its formal rules. I learn grammar and vocubulary that goes beyond the topics or colloquialisms from conversations with my parents or lola. My teacher is not as forgiving when i slip into the wrong word or verb tense, giving me rigor and encouragement that i don't get at home. I learn Filipino phrases for the Real World of economics, politics, journalism, and philosophy. It is difficult. Shockingly, i learned the formal word for teacher (guro) for the first time this year. The building blocks of my understanding are simply being rearranged with more structure and sorted into buckets of dialectic differentiation. (sidenote: given how challenging this is in a language i already know, i admire all the polyglots of the world starting from scratch)
    <br></br>
    All this to say, happy Filipino American History Month! Being Filipino is a practice of honoring our elders in every possible way, working towards justice and freedom, and crafting a better future for generations we will never know. All this starts small; i am finally rebuilding my Filipino community in boston after being separated from the bay for two years and it is saving my life. I hope everyone gets to find their cultural community too, and find themselves within their history.

    Padaba ko ang Pilipinas. I love the Philippines. Atin ang kinabukasan. The future is ours.
